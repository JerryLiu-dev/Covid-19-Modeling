# Covid-19-Modeling
An exploration into COVID 19 Temporal Statistics with extensive modeling, visualization, and prediction.
## Problem

The severity of COVID became and remains a contested topic. There also remains criticism in how different political leaders have approached the issue. While trying to see what characteristics of a county may be indicative of how hard COVID impacted different areas, we questioned whether the population of a county would be correlated with the number of COVID cases identified. As a result, we propose the null hypothesis that the number of COVID cases per capita is not correlated with the population of a county. Likewise, our alternative hypothesis is that the number of COVID cases per capita is positively correlated with the population of a county. Counties were classified as small, medium, or large depending on if their 2020 population fell in the lower, middle, or upper third of county population sizes in 2020.
